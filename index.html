    <p>Right-click on any webpage, click Inspect, and you'll see the innards of that site: its source code, the images and CSS that form its design, the fonts and icons it uses, the Javascript code that powers animations, and more. You can see how long the site takes to load, how much bandwidth it used to download, and the exact color in its text. Or, you could use it to change anything you want on the page.
        
        Inspect Element is a perfect way to learn what makes the web tick, figure out what's broken on your sites, mock up what a color and font change would look like, and keep yourself from having to Photoshop out private details in screenshots.

If you're reading this on your phone, it's time to switch over to your laptop, open Google Chrome, and get ready to tweak some code.</p>
        
        <p>Most web browsers—including Mozilla Firefox and Apple's Safari—include an Inspect Element tool, while Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Edge browser include a similar set of Developer Tools. This tutorial focuses on Google Chrome's Inspect Element tools, but most of the features work the same in other browsers. Chrome inspect element

       <p>For these and dozens of other use cases, Inspect Element is a handy tool to keep around. It's part of the Developer Tools in your browser, which includes a number of extra features: a console to run code, a View Source page to see just the raw code behind a site, a Sources page with a list of every file loaded in a website, and more. You can explore all those on your own, but for now, let's see how to use the main Elements tab to tweak a webpage on our own.</p>
       <p>How to Get Started with Inspect Element:</p>
        
        <p>There are a few ways to access Google Chrome Inspect Element. Just open a website you want to try editing (to follow along with this tutorial, open Zapier.com), then open the Inspect Element tools in one of these three ways:</p>
        
        <p>Right-click anywhere on the webpage, and at the very bottom of the menu that pops up, you will see "Inspect." Click that.</p>
        
            <p>Click the hamburger menu (the icon with 3 stacked dots) on the far right of your Google Chrome toolbar, click More Tools, then select Developer Tools. Alternately, in the file menu, click View —> Developer —> Developer Tools.</p>
        
           <p>Prefer keyboard shortcuts? Press CMD+Option+I on a Mac, or F12 on a PC to open Inspect Elements without clicking anything.</p>
        
  <p>By default, the Developer Tools open in a pane at the very bottom of your browser and will show the Elements tab—that's the famed Inspect Element tool we've been looking for.</p>
        
       <p>You won't have much space to work with Inspect Element at the bottom of your screen, so click the three vertical dots on the top right-hand side of the inspect element pane near the "X" (which you'd click to close the pane). Now, you'll see an option to move the pane to the right-hand side of your browser (right-dock view) or to open the pane in a completely separate window (undock view).</p>
